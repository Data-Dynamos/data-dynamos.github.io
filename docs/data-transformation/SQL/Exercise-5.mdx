# Exercise 5

## Create Table for Aggregate Country Temperatures


The objective of this exercise is to aggregate temperature measurements per country on an annual basis using the data from the `stg_temperatures_by_country` source. 
Additionally, you will need to clean up the "Country" column by removing leading/trailing spaces and converting the country names to the proper format.

To create a table called `aggregate_country_temperatures` with the desired columns in the `global_temperatures` schema:

1. Investigate the data in the `stg_temperatures_by_country` source for any data quality issues.
2. Clean up the "Country" column, removing leading/trailing spaces and converting the country names to the proper format using the `initcap` function.
3. Remove any occurrences of the Lenny face '( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)' from the AverageTemperature column.
4. Aggregate the temperature measurements per country on an annual basis.
5. Ignore any 'Uncertainty' columns for this project.
6. Select the following columns for the output table:
   - Year: Integer
   - Country: String
   - AverageTemperature: Float
