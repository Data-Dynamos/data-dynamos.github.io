# Exercise 3 

## Create View for Aggregate Global Temperatures

To analyze temperature measurements globally on an annual basis, you will create a view called `aggregate_global_temperatures` based on the `stg_global_temperatures` table in the `global_temperatures` schema . This view will group the data by year and provide aggregated temperature values using the appropriate aggregation functions.

To create the view and extract the desired columns:

1. Select the `Date`, `LandAverageTemperature`, `LandMaxTemperature`, `LandMinTemperature`, and `LandAndOceanAverageTemperature` columns from the `stg_global_temperatures` table.
2. Extract the year from the `Date` column to obtain only the year portion of the date.
3. Apply the suitable aggregation functions, such as `AVG` for average temperature, to calculate the desired values for each year.
4. Ignore any 'Uncertainty' columns for this project.

The resulting view should have the following columns:

- Year: Integer
- LandAverageTemperature: Float
- LandMaxTemperature: Float
- LandMinTemperature: Float
- LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: Float

Note data 2022-01-19 try to extract 2022 alone
