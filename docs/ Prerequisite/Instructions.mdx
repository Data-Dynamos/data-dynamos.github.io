## Instructions for Setting up the Virtual Environment

:::note

To ensure compatibility with Snowpark and Streamlit, it is recommended to install **Python 3.8.16** version.

:::


1. Install Python 3.8.16: Visit the Python website (https://www.python.org) and download Python 3.8.16 for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt: Launch a terminal or command prompt on your machine.

3. Create a virtual environment: Run the following command to create a new virtual environment named "myenv":

   ```
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment: Depending on your operating system, run the appropriate command to activate the virtual environment:

- For **Windows**:

     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

- For **macOS/Linux**:

     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install required packages: Once the virtual environment is activated, use `pip` to install the necessary packages:

   ```
   pip install dbt streamlit
   ```

6. Verify the installation: Run the following commands to ensure that dbt and Streamlit are successfully installed:

   ```
   dbt --version
   streamlit --version
   ```

   You should see the versions of dbt and Streamlit displayed in the output.

7. Your virtual environment is now set up and ready to use for your ELT pipeline and Streamlit development.

8. When you finish working with the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running the command:

   ```
   deactivate
   ```
